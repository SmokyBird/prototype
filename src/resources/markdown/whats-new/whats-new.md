There is now a discord server!

The server aims to keep everyone informed about the latest developments and serve as a hub for streamlined feedback. Youâ€™ll be able to share suggestions, report bugs, and stay up-to-date with the project, all in one place.

## Improved Team Logos

Based on user feedback about the previous team logos feeling too medieval and out of sync with the app's overall aesthetic, the team logos have been refreshed.

They now feature a more modern, e-sports-inspired look that better complements the app's style.

## Team Details

A new team details page has been added which provides a closer look at each team's journey.

Check out current standings in the domestic division, review performance trends from previous seasons, and explore the biggest achievements in a dedicated trophy case.

## Match Settings Reset

A small QoL update has been made to improve usability: on-the-fly settings will now reset automatically after each match.

This way, if setting the map to `de_train` for one match, it will revert to the default without requiring a manual reset.
